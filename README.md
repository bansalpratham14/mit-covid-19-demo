# Problem
-Significant risk of COVID-19 due to patients travelling to pharmacies and providers
-High risk patient health and chronic disease treatment due to lack of protocol and drug adherence during COVID-19, due to lockdowns, lack of transportation and overall resource gaps.
-Today in Africa there is lack of interoperable standards for prescription leading to risks for the patient population and inefficiencies in treatment delivery.

# Solution
- We have created a multi-channel capability (supporting USSD and responsive media) which will allow us to send prescriptions to providers and pharmacies, and mediate the patient, provider, pharmacy relationship.
- We are building an intelligent backend to be able to address distribution, national regulatory, national distribution models, geographic and cultural limitations using AI/ML to improve delivery and address interaction risks.
- We are building an interoperable prescription drug specification to meet the African context including regulations, business process, population health and cultural differences.
